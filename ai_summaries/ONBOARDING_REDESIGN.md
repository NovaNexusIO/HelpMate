- Spring physics for natural movement
- Staggered animations for sequential elements
- State transitions (empty → filled → success)
- Feedback on interactions (tap, drag, etc.)

### 3. **Color System**
- **Blue (#4c6ef5):** Primary actions, progress

- **Green:** Success states, verification
- **Amber:** Warnings and info
- **Pink, Blue, Purple:** Role-specific colors

### 4. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Progress indicators on all steps (1/4, 2/4, etc.)
- Back navigation throughout
- Clear step titles and descriptions
- Help text and info boxes

### 5. **Mobile-First**

- Clear visual feedback
- Easy-to-read text sizes
- Scroll areas where needed

## Technical Implementation

### Type Updates
```typescript
// Added to types/index.ts
export type AuthScreen = 
  'splash' | 'onboarding' | 'language' | 'userDetails' | 
  'aadhar' | 'otp' | 'role' | 'verification' | 'pledge' | 'main';

export type UserRole = 'volunteer' | 'receiver' | 'donor' | null;
export type VerificationType = 'orphanage' | 'ngo' | 'driver' | 'none';

export interface UserDetails {
  name: string;
  phone: string;
  email?: string;
  aadhar: string;
  language: string;
  role: UserRole;
  verificationType: VerificationType;
}
```

### App Flow Management
- State management in `App.tsx`
- Sequential screen transitions
- Back navigation support
- Data accumulation across steps
- Conditional verification based on role

### Animation Libraries Used
- **Framer Motion:** Primary animation library
- `motion` components for declarative animations
- `AnimatePresence` for enter/exit animations
- Layout animations with `layoutId`
- Spring physics for natural movement
